# vim-easymotion-segments

An EasyMotion extension plugin that allows jumping to variable segments in words. A variable segment is defined to be a
substring in any identifier character followed by an underscore ("snake case") or a lowercase identifier character
followed by an uppercase character ("camel case"). Read [here](https://github.com/Julian/vim-textobj-variable-segment)
for a better explanation.

This plugin was inspired by [vim-textobj-variable-segment](https://github.com/Julian/vim-textobj-variable-segment), a
[vim-textobj-user](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user) extension that enables manipulating variable segments as
text objects. I highly recommend using these two plugins in conjunction with vim-easymotion-segments.


Requires [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion).
